Course Description: This course is designed around the core concepts and teaching objectives of the emerging field of embodied artificial intelligence. It focuses on cultivating students' deep understanding and practical application skills in the fundamental principles of embodied intelligence, machine learning and large model technologies, and methods for integrating hardware and software systems. The course includes understanding the principles and challenges of embodied artificial intelligence, learning to design and implement large model-based intelligent algorithms that enable autonomous decision-making and physical interaction, developing skills to create intelligent interactive systems integrating sensors and actuators based on large model technology, and gaining practical experience by designing prototypes of embodied intelligent systems that interact with the environment and humans.
